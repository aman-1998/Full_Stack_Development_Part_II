<h2><strong>Note:-</strong></h2>
The folders are named as <i>conceptName_NserialNo</i>, for example Dependency_Injection_N13, Spring_Bean_N21, etc. It is recommended to follow the order while learning. This tutorial will be extremely beneficial for those who want to learn advanced back-end and front-end in Java.

<h2><strong>About:-</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><h3>Spring5_Dependency_Injection_N38</h3> - This is an app to understand bean creation by Spring in runtime using @Component annotation. Here, Spring will create the object in runtime and inject it. @ComponentScan is used along with @Configuration to specify the packages that are to be scanned by spring. The configuration will be applicable only for those packages.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_Autowire_N39</h3> - This is an app to understand dependency injection using @Autowired annotation. Here, Spring will try to create object for classes with @Component annotation. During creation of object if some properties needed to be injected with their object (i.e., if there are some dependencies) then spring will take care of that in runtime. @ComponentScan is used along with @Configuration to specify the packages that are to be scanned by spring. The configuration will be applicable only for those packages.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_Aitowire_Qualifier_N40</h3> - This is an app to understand the use of @Qualifier annotation. Here, Spring will try to create object for the class with @Component annotation during object creation if there is any dependency which is ambiguous then that ambiguity can be resolved using @Qualifier annotation. @ComponentScan is used along with @Configuration to specify the packages that are to be scanned by spring. The configuration will be applicable only for those packages.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_Spring_Bean_and_Constructor_Injection_N41</h3> - This is an app to understand bean declaration using @Bean annotation and also the example of constructor-injection is covered. @ComponentScan is used along with @Configuration to specify the packages that are to be scanned by spring. The configuration will be applicable only for those packages.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_Spring_MVC_minimal_setup_N42</h3> - This is an app with minimal setup and dependencies in pom.xml to start Spring MVC. Here, @RequestMapping annotation is used inside controller class (with @Controller annotation) to map the request url. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_Spring_MVC_basic_form_N43</h3> - This is an app with basic form. Form is submitted to an url which is mapped with an API in controller class. In that API all the field value are extracted using HttpServletRequest object and then these values are passed to JSP view using the same HttpServletRequest object (eg., request.setAttribute("gender", gender)). In JSP file values are displayed using JSP Scripting Elements (eg., <%= request.getAttribute("gender") %>). SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_form_requestParam_model_N44</h3> - In this app, when form is being submitted to an url which is mapped to displayInfo API in controller, the field values are extracted using @RequestParam in the API and then these values are passed to the JSP view using Model object (eg., model.addAttribute("languages", languages)). In JSP page, field values are displayed using expression language and JSTL tags. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_form_modelAndView_N45</h3> - In this app, when form is being submitted to an url which is mapped to displayInfo API in controller, the field values are extracted using @RequestParam in the API and then these values are passed to the JSP view using ModelAndView object (eg., modelAndView.addObject("languages", languages)). In JSP pages, field values are displayed using expression language and JSTL tags. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_form_using_css_js_validation_N46</h3> - In this app, when form is being submitted, there will be client-side validations. If validation passes then the form will be submitted to an url which is mapped to displayInfo API in controller. The field values are extracted using @RequestParam in the API. Then there will be a validation in the server-side (even when javaScript is disabled for the browser, server-side validation will work). If there is no server-side validation then these values are passed to the 'displayInformation' JSP view using ModelAndView object (eg., modelAndView.addObject("languages", languages)). In JSP pages, field values are displayed using expression language and JSTL tags. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_form_customized_error_message_N47</h3> - In this app, when form is being submitted, there will be client-side validations. If validation passes then the form will be submitted to an url which is mapped to displayInfo API in controller. The field values are extracted using @RequestParam in the API. Then there will be a validation in the server-side (even when javaScript is disabled for the browser, server-side validation will work). If there is no server-side validation then these values are passed to the 'displayInformation' JSP view using ModelAndView object (eg., modelAndView.addObject("languages", languages)). In JSP pages, field values are displayed using expression language and JSTL tags and are beautified with CSS. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_form_element_N48</h3> - In this app, customer-form is made using JSTL form elements. When customer-form is being submitted, there will be client-side validations. If validation passes then the form will be submitted to an url which is mapped to displayInformation API in controller. The field values are extracted from Customer entity using @ModelAttribute in the API. Then there will be a validation in the server-side (even when javaScript is disabled for the browser, server-side validation will work). If there is no server-side validation then the entity is passed to the 'displayInformation' JSP view using ModelAndView object (eg., modelAndView.addObject("customer", customer)). In JSP pages, field values are displayed using expression language and JSTL tags and are beautified with CSS. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_form_elements_N49</h3> - In this app, customer-form is made using JSTL form elements and radio, dropdown and checkboxes are populated dynamically using Map. When customer-form is being submitted, there will be client-side validations. If validation passes then the form will be submitted to an url which is mapped to displayInformation API in controller. The field values are extracted from Customer entity using @ModelAttribute in the API. Then there will be a validation in the server-side (even when javaScript is disabled for the browser, server-side validation will work). If there is no server-side validations then the entity is passed to the 'displayInformation' JSP view using ModelAndView object (eg., modelAndView.addObject("customer", customer)). In JSP pages, field values are displayed using expression language and JSTL tags and are beautified with CSS. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_form_repopulation_validation_N50</h3> - In this app, customer-form is made using JSTL form elements and radio, dropdown and checkboxes are populated dynamically using Map. When customer-form is being submitted, there will be client-side validations. If validation passes then the form will be submitted to an url which is mapped to displayInformation API in controller. The field values are extracted from Customer entity using @ModelAttribute in the API. Then there will be a validation in the server-side. To display these server-side validation error messages in the customer-form, the form is repopulated with submitted values and error messages are shown using object of BindingResult (even when javaScript is disabled for the browser, server-side validation will work). If there is no server-side validation then the entity is passed to the 'displayInformation' JSP view using ModelAndView object (eg., modelAndView.addObject("customer", customer)). In JSP pages, field values are displayed using expression language and JSTL tags and are beautified with CSS. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_form_hibernate_validator_N51</h3> - In this app, customer-form is made using JSTL form elements and radio, dropdown and checkboxes are populated dynamically using Map. When customer-form is being submitted, there will be client-side validations. If validation passes then the form will be submitted to an url which is mapped to displayInformation API in controller. The field values are extracted from Customer entity using @ModelAttribute in the API. Then there will be a validation in the server-side. Server-side validation is achieved using custom validate method as well as by using annotations on property of Customer entity (Hibernate-Validator). To make hibernate-validator work we need to use @Valid annotation. To display these server-side validation error messages in the customer-form, the form is repopulated with submitted values and error messages are shown using object of BindingResult (even when javaScript is disabled for the browser, server-side validation will work). If there is no server-side validation then the entity is passed to the 'displayInformation' JSP view using ModelAndView object (eg., modelAndView.addObject("customer", customer)). In JSP pages, field values are displayed using expression language and JSTL tags and are beautified with CSS. SpringSample-servlet.xml file in WEB-INF folder has the Bean configuration to tell Spring about the location of view (.jsp) and template files.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_DB_connectivity_usingXMLconfig_N52</h3> - In this app, there is customer-form. One can create a customer by submitting the form. Both cliet-side and server-side validations are added in the app. If javaScript for the browser is disabled then, also server-side validation will work. Both server and client side validation messages are shown on Customer-Form UI. To connect with database xml based configuration is used. User can update and delete from UI. </li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringMVC_DB_connectivity_Annotation_CRUD_N53</h3> - In this app, there is customer-form. One can create a customer by submitting the form. Both cliet-side and server-side validations are added in the app. If javaScript for the browser is disabled then, also server-side validation will work. Both server and client side validation messages are shown on Customer-Form UI. To connect with database Annotation based configuration is used. User can update and delete from UI.

There is a POJO class Brand which represents database table with name Brand. Hiibernate is connected to the database using hibernate.cfg.xml file. Since, Brand is the entity class, so, different annotations(like @Entity, @Table, @Id, @Column, etc) are used to tell hibernate about the specifications of the entity. @GeneratedValue and @SequenceGenerator is used to auto-increment Brand_Id (pk) using the BRAND_SEQUENCE which is a sequence in the oracle database to generate Brand_Id by incrementing one. The the REST APIs in this app will produce and consume XML data.</li>
  <li><h3>RestApp_JERSEY_CRUD_with_JSON_N57</h3> - This is a rest-app in which supports CRUD operation on Brand table in database. There is a POJO class Brand which represents database table with name Brand. Hiibernate is connected to the database using hibernate.cfg.xml file. Since, Brand is the entity class, so, different annotations(like @Entity, @Table, @Id, @Column, etc) are used to tell hibernate about the specifications of the entity. @GeneratedValue and @SequenceGenerator is used to auto-increment Brand_Id (pk) using the BRAND_SEQUENCE which is a sequence in the oracle database to generate Brand_Id by incrementing one. The the REST APIs in this app will produce and consume JSON data.</li>
  <li><h3>RestApp_JERSEY_adding_subResource_N58</h3> - This is a rest-app in which there are two POJO classes Brand and Product. APIs are called based on endpoints and type of request. The type of data consumed during POST and PUT request is JSON and PLAIN_TEXT is returned in response. The type of data produced during GET request is JSON and during DELETE is PLAIN_TEXT.

  </li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringSecurity_part5_CSRF_N102</h3> - In this project I integrated Spring 5 and SpringSecurity 5.0 and made a web app with login logout functionality. For demonstration purpose I used <form> tag instead of <form:form> tag and manually included CSRF token in the request.
	  <p>
	  	Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do 		not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from 			interfering with each other.
	  </p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringSecurity_part6_User_Roles_N103</h3> - In this project I integrated Spring 5 and SpringSecurity 5.0 and made a web app with login logout functionality. Along with that I also showed username and all the roles for him using SpringSecurity JSTL taglib.</li>
  <li><h3>Spring5_SpringSecurity_part7_role_based_access_N104</h3> - In this project I integrated Spring 5 and SpringSecurity 5.0 and made a web app with login logout functionality. Along with that I also showed username and all the roles for him using SpringSecurity JSTL taglib. One more functionality added to the web-app is role based access to different web resources.</li>
  <li><h3>/Spring5_SpringSecurity_part8_role_access_denied_N105</h3> - In this project I integrated Spring 5 and SpringSecurity 5.0 and made a web app with login logout functionality. Along with that I also showed username and all the roles for him using SpringSecurity JSTL taglib. One more functionality added to the web-app is role based access to different web resources. I have also added functionality of custom Access-Denied page for any unauthorized access.
	  <p>Some of the highlighted features are as follows:-</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Resources from css, js and images folder are allowed and we don't need to authentication for that.</li>
		<li>Any url with pattern "/notice/**" and "/holiday/**" can be accessed by users with role "STUDENT", "TEACHER", "ADMIN". But without authentication these urls won't be accessible. And if we click on that url without being authenticated, we will be redirected to the login-page.</li>
		<li>Any url with pattern "/performance" can be accessed by users with role "TEACHER"</li>
		<li>Any url with pattern "/pendingFees" can be accessed by users with role "ADMIN"</li>
		<li>Any url for which there is some role assigned, if we try to access that url without logging in then we will be redirected to the login page. After logging in successfully we will either be directly redirected to the page that we tried to access earlier or to the Access-Denied Page depending on the role of the logged in user. But if we click on "Login" button from any page, we will be redirected to login page and after logging in successfully we will be redirected to "/" url or the url specified in MySpringMvcDispatcherServletInitializer class under method getServletMappings().</li>
		<li>After logout we will be redirected to login page (This is the default behavior). In the login page here we have a Home button.</li>
		<li>As a logged in user if we try to access any url which is meant to be used by a user with different role then we will be redirected to the Access-Denied page.</li>
